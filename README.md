## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- creating a custom range slider. This was a big challenge and required a lot of googling and reading around the topic.
- [Here is a codepen I created while working on the slider design](https://codepen.io/emjogale/pen/yLPVYXv)
- how to center an absolutely positioned element using negative margin

### Continued development

- how to refactor the Javascript, as I think it is quite clumsy at the moment
- how to make the slider look the same across all browsers - and in the solution/design comparison!

### Useful resources

- [Creating A Custom Range Input That Looks Consistent Across All Browsers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/create-custom-range-input-consistent-browsers/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-490&utm_medium=email#comments-create-custom-range-input-consistent-browsers) this is an excellent resource which clearly explains the steps required to style a custom slider for a consistent cross-browser result -[Positioning Elements on the Web](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/positioning#position)
